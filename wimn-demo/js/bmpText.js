The Permittee shall develop and implement stormwater control measures, including BMPs that restrict the facility industrial stormwater discharges to the extent necessary to preserve the existing high quality, or to preserve the wilderness, scientific, recreational, or other special characteristics that make the water an Outstanding Resource Value Water. In addition, a benchmark value of 65 mg/L for Solids, Total Suspended (TSS) applies to the discharge at a benchmark monitoring location, instead of 100 mg/L as specified in the sector requirements of Appendix B. If the Permittee has a waiver from the requirements to conduct benchmark monitoring, the benchmark value does not apply. The SWPPP must contain the following components: a. A selection of industrial stormwater volume reduction and/or pollutant concentration reduction BMPs, designed to restrict industrial stormwater discharges to the designated water. The SWPPP must include necessary calculations to demonstrate the effectiveness of the chosen BMPs in reducing volume and/or pollutant concentrations. BMP options the Permittee can include, but are not limited to, removing industrial activities and/or significant materials from contact with rain or snowmelt, re-use of industrial stormwater, stormwater ponding, infiltration, filtration, porous pavement, constructed wetlands, evaporation, evapotranspiration, etc. b. A narrative discussion describing how the Permittee will monitor and maintain the BMPs the Permittee uses long-term, to ensure the industrial facility will sustain restricted industrial stormwater discharges.
